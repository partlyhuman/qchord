SamVS Change History (from V5.125)
==================================
V5.126, dlinkP16 V5.126
- Fix(Link): Aligning txth segment to offset 0x0400 if it would begin at 0..0x3FF
- Mod: Enhanced Dependency check before build with files sorted in a more complex file structures.
- New: Constant _SAMVS_P24_BUILD defined during compilation of P24 code (may be used in shared include files)

V5.127, dlinkP16 V5.127
- Fix: FASTDATA segment not placed correctly if XDATA is placed in different segment
- New: TableHelper exports binary data (little endian)
- Mod: "DQSPI Pairing Mismatch!" now displays mismatching register contents
- Fix: _cptr32 loads 0 (effectively DP1L) if argument is actually a 16 Bit pointer loaded from stack (warning "Segment information missing, using current segment" emitted)
- New: _cptr32unsafe, same as _cptr32 but without missing segment warning (silently use DP1H)
- New: _CODEPAGE(), returns current page (effectively DP1H, similar to assembler CODEPAGE constant)
- Fix(Trace): Better interpretation of 16 Bit constant pointers using current code segment (before previously known IP was used)
- Mod(Trace): Enhanced guessing on 16 Bit pointers embedded in 32 Bit argument (%16pu for example). After trying data segment, current code segment is checked.

libBwBlt
========
V4.625
- Mod, SAM5xxx: _BwBlt_Init changed to macro for proper cross segment adressing

libFX48
=======
V4.612
- StInsFx: added _StInsFx_SetFilterType function

libFX5000
=========
V4.626
- VoiceProcessor: corrections for the SetSampleRate function
V4.627
- SpringReverb: fix in SpringReverb_Init to correctly use 16bit low address portion

libGM2S
=======
V4.631
- relocatable soundbank with size greater than 0x80:0000 can now be on startaddress multiple of 0x80:0000 (before 0x100:0000)
- in mode random, the random number generated is now common to all groups (before each group had its own random)

libMP3
======
V4.631
- Mod: VBR Frames placed by LAME as a frame filler no longer skipped

libNFM
======
V4.634
- improved execution time of NFM_Init

libSys
======
V4.642
- New: _Sys_GetTimer2Rate
V4.643
- Fix: Return Value of _DSPalloc if no free DSP could be found was 0, changed to -1 as documented
- Mod: _LoadP24 disables interrupt when running from encrypted firmware during DSP load

libUXChg
========
V4.637
- added EON EN35QX512A and ZETTA SPI Flash devices into UXC2D_GENERIC_QSPI driver list
